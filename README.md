*Starter pack for SA2*

## What Worked Well
Following the instructions and figuring out the counter.

## What Didn't
I tried to implement the favicon by following the documentation. However, it wasn't working, and the TAs I went to also couldn't figure out how to solve the issue. The issue was that the favicon in the inspect element was still the automatic one instead of the logo url that we put in the vite.config.js.
