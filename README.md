# Animal Life Posts

*A redux frontend platform of animal posts*

## What Worked Well
I was able to understand the data flow and implement it relatively easily. For some of the API calls, I sometimes had to do multiple on certain actions (delete, add, update) so that there isn't a half a second period of time where the deleted post/not-yet added post/before updated post shows up on the main posts page.

## What Didn't

## Extra Credit
I used a react library called Masonry that tiles the posts so that the posts below it rises up to fill the gaps. I also styled the buttons and icons. I was proud of having the add button rotate and stay there if the user is on the create post page.
