# Recipe Client

## Overview

## Things to note
As I mentioned in the API readme, I found that with the free version of Render, it delays api requests if I don't use it for a while (this was the note on the render site: Your free instance will spin down with inactivity, which can delay requests by 50 seconds or more.) Thus, when you first use this site, it might not seem to work properly, but you just have to wait a minute for the first recipe.
