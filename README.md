# Recipe Client

## Description
The client side of this recipe platform. A user can add/edit a recipe, search for a recipe by title or tags, and keep track of their favorite recipes. I was really busy this term finishing up my winter SWE internship, which rolled over 5 weeks into this term and then had midterms and got a really bad cold, so this project was something I had to finish within a day. I took inspiration and starter code for the front and backend from the CS52 project and added more features to it. 

## How to run locally
`npm run dev`

## Things to note
As I mentioned in the API readme, I found that with the free version of Render, it delays api requests if I don't use it for a while (this was the note on the render site: Your free instance will spin down with inactivity, which can delay requests by 50 seconds or more.) Thus, when you first use this site, it might not seem to work properly, but you just have to wait a minute for the first recipe.
